Customer Profile Management – View and Update Customer Details

**Description:**
----------------

As a registered customer,I want to view and update my personal profile information,so that I can maintain accurate details like name, date of birth, gender, and profile picture in my account.

This story enables customers to view and update their personal information stored in the Users and Customers tables.The feature supports the **My Profile page**, which retrieves user details, allows editing, validates input, uploads a profile picture, and logs updates.

**Preconditions:**
------------------

1.  The user is logged in successfully and has a valid session.
    
2.  A record exists in the Customers table with a valid UserId reference.
    
3.  Email and Phone fields are verified and cannot be edited.
    
4.  The “My Profile” page is accessible from the user dashboard menu.
    
5.  The backend APIs /api/customer/{customerId} and /api/customer/update are active and connected to the frontend.
    

**Acceptance Criteria**
-----------------------

### **Scenario 1: Navigate to “My Profile” Page**

**Given** I am logged into the RouteBuddy web application

*   The dashboard menu is visible.
    
*   The “My Profile” option is available at top right.
    

**When** I click on the **“My Profile”** option

*   The system triggers a GET /api/customer/{customerId} request to fetch the user profile data.
    
*   A loading spinner appears with text: **“Fetching your profile…”**.
    

**Then**

*   The page displays:
    
    *   First Name, Middle Name, Last Name
        
    *   Date of Birth (DD-MM-YYYY format)
        
    *   Gender (Dropdown: Male, Female, Other)
        
    *   Email (disabled input field)
        
    *   Phone (disabled input field)
        
    *   Profile Picture (thumbnail or default avatar)
        
    *   Computed values: Full Name and Age (read-only fields)
        
*   The “Edit Profile” and “Upload Picture” buttons are visible.
    

### **Scenario 2: Edit Customer Profile**

**Given** I am on the “My Profile” page

*   I can see the **Edit Profile** button in the top-right section.
    

**When** I click the **Edit Profile** button

*   All editable fields (First Name, Middle Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Gender) become enabled.
    
*   The **Save Changes** and **Cancel** buttons appear below the form.
    
*   Validation indicators (red asterisks for required fields) are shown beside First Name, Last Name, and Date of Birth.
    

**Then** I can modify:

*   First Name: accepts alphabetic characters only, max 50 chars.
    
*   Middle Name: optional, alphabetic only, max 50 chars.
    
*   Last Name: required, alphabetic, max 50 chars.
    
*   Date of Birth: opens a date picker (must be a past date).
    
*   Gender: dropdown options (Male, Female, Other).
    

**When** I click **Save Changes**

*   The system validates each field using EF Core annotation rules.
    
*   If invalid:
    
    *   Inline validation messages appear, e.g.,
        
        *   “First Name is required.”
            
        *   “Invalid Date of Birth.”
            
*   If valid:
    
    *   The frontend calls PUT /api/customer/update with the updated data.
        
    *   A loading bar appears with text: **“Saving your details…”**.
        
    *   Upon success:
        
        *   API response includes updated customer details.
            
        *   The form auto-disables and switches back to view mode.
            
        *   ✅ “Profile updated successfully.”
            

**And** the system logs this event:

*   MagicStrings.Logging.CustomerProfileUpdate with timestamp, UserId, and updated fields.
    
*   The UpdatedBy and UpdatedOn fields in the database are refreshed.
    

### **Scenario 3: Upload Customer Profile Picture**

**Given** I am on the “My Profile” page

*   My current profile picture or placeholder avatar is displayed.
    

**When** I hover over the profile image

*   A tooltip appears: **“Change Profile Picture”**.
    
*   A camera icon (📷) overlay is shown.
    

**When** I click the icon

*   A file picker opens allowing selection of .jpg, .jpeg, or .png files (max size: 2 MB).
    
*   Once a file is selected:
    
    *   A preview of the selected image is shown.
        
    *   The **Upload** and **Cancel** buttons appear below the preview.
        

**When** I click **Upload**

*   The frontend validates the file type and size.
    
*   ⚠️ “Invalid file type or size. Please upload a JPG/PNG image under 2 MB.”
    
*   If valid:
    
    *   The image is sent to PUT /api/customer/profile-picture.
        
    *   Backend stores the image in the Customers.ProfilePicture column (VARBINARY(MAX)).
        
    *   The image on the UI updates instantly to the new picture.
        
    *   ✅ “Profile picture updated successfully.”
        

**And** the system logs:

*   MagicStrings.Logging.CustomerProfilePictureUpdated event with timestamp and UserId.
    

### **Scenario 4: Validation and Data Integrity**

**Given** I try to submit a form with invalid or missing values**When** I click **Save Changes**

*   The system performs validation based on EF Core annotations:
    
    *   \[Required\], \[MaxLength(50)\], \[Comment\], \[ForeignKey\].
        
*   If invalid:
    
    *   Red border highlights the field.
        
    *   Inline validation messages appear below each field.
        
*   No API call is triggered until validation passes.
    

**Then**

*   Only valid data is persisted.
    
*   The computed properties FullName and Age remain \[NotMapped\].
    
*   Data integrity between User and Customer remains intact.
    

**Database Actions**
--------------------

**Tables Involved:**

1.  **Users Table** – (Email, Phone, Role, IsEmailVerified, IsActive)
    
    *   Read-only in this module.
        
2.  **Customers Table** – (FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth, Gender, ProfilePicture, UserId, UpdatedBy, UpdatedOn)
    
    *   Updated when user saves changes.
        

**On successful update:**

*   Record is updated with new data.
    
*   UpdatedBy = Current UserId.
    
*   UpdatedOn = Current UTC Timestamp.
    
*   Audit trail logs entry in MagicStrings.Logging.
